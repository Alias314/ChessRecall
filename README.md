# ChessRecall

ChessRecall is a Chess opening trainer website that uses spaced repitition to enforce opening moves. Users may input manually the various moves of their chosen opening. Based on the inputed moves, the system will give the user a random position from that opening, they will then have select the "correct" move or the move that they've inputed before. The system will automatically decide when to show the position again based on your performance.
